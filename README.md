A port of the Jekyll theme Hyde by Poole to Statamic.

I based the code for the theme on the Denali that ships with Statamic.

## Getting Started

Install statamic

Download and copy this theme into the _themes folder

Update your settings.yml to use the theme

Looking for demo? I'm using a slighly customized version of this theme for my <a href="http://mubs.me">personal blog</a>.
